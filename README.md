# NATS Jetstream Dead Queue Letter

## üìò Diagram Explanation: JetStream DLQ Flow
- The Service publishes a message to a subject (e.g., jobs.taskA) in the JetStream stream called jobs.

- NATS JetStream receives the message and delivers it to the Worker via a configured consumer (e.g., job_consumer).

- The Worker is expected to process the message and send an ACK back to NATS if successful.

- If the Worker fails to process the message (e.g., crashes, logic error, or does not ACK), JetStream will redeliver the message up to a configured max_deliver count (e.g., 5 times).

- After exceeding the maximum delivery attempts without a successful ACK, JetStream emits an advisory event to the subject:

```bash
$JS.EVENT.ADVISORY.CONSUMER.MAX_DELIVERIES.jobs.job_consumer
```

- This event includes metadata about the failed message, such as subject, sequence number, delivery count, and more.

- The advisory is captured by a separate stream ‚Äî the DLQ Stream ‚Äî which stores these events for further inspection, retry logic, or alerting.

## üîç Purpose of the DLQ Stream
- Acts as a holding area for messages that consistently fail processing.

- Helps operators and developers monitor failure patterns.

- Allows for manual or automated replay of failed messages.

- Integrates with logging, alerting, or incident management systems.

## Jetstream Setup

At the first, we need to define stream named `jobs`.

```bash
‚ùØ nats stream -s localhost:4222 create jobs                                                                                                         
? Subjects jobs.*.*
? Storage file
? Replication 1
? Retention Policy Work Queue
? Discard Policy New
? Stream Messages Limit 50000
? Per Subject Messages Limit -1
? Total Stream Size 256MB
? Message TTL 7d
? Max Message Size -1
? Duplicate tracking time window 2m0s
? Allow message Roll-ups No
? Allow message deletion Yes
? Allow purging subjects or the entire stream Yes

Next, we need to add another job that will act as Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

```bash
nats stream -s localhost:4222 create jobs_dlq                                                                                                        ‚îÄ‚ïØ
